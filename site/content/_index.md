title: Welcome to Awesome ChatGPT API
description: hello
---

Curated list of apps and tools that not only use the new [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat), but also allow users to configure their own [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), enabling free and on-demand usage of their own quota.

There's also a [Development](#development) section that provides developers with a collection of projects and articles to help them build better.

> Curated by [Reorx](https://reorx.com), you are welcome to suggest new projects via Twitter or PRs, but please ensure you have read the [Collection Standard](https://github.com/reorx/awesome-chatgpt-api/issues/21).
